# Responsive Web Design
In this Journey I will build 20 Projects using HTML and CSS.
<br>
First, I'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, I'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.
<br>
Finally, I'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.

It introduces me to different HTML Tags and elements and their attributes.
